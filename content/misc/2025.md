The number 2025 is indeed a fascinating one with numerous interesting mathematical properties, because 2025 can be obtained by squaring the 9th triangular number and as result, one of the most remarkable facts about 2025 is, that it's the sum of the cubes of all single-digit numbers at the same time:


$$
2025 = 45^2
$$

$$
2025 = (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)^2
$$

$$
2025=1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3+5^3+6^3+7^3+8^3+9^3
$$

Its because of [Nicomachusâ€™s Theorem](https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2010/03/04/nichomachuss-theorem/):
$$
\left(\sum_{n=1}^k n\right)^2 = \sum_{n=1}^k n^3
$$

Nappy new, 2025th year!
