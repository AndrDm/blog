## Save for Previous Version
Introduced in LabVIEW 2024 

```ini
FeatureToggle.Editor.ProjectSaveVersion=True
```

This feature allows you to use LabVIEW 2024 Q1 to edit VIs that can be opened with older versions of the LabVIEW editor. This allows you to collaborate on a project with others who havenâ€™t upgraded to the same version of LabVIEW that you are using.

How it works:

Don't forget to mark VIs to be saved in previous version:

The Version will appear on ToolBar and in the Properties:
