A very simple and basic TCP communication example for Python and LabVIEW
<!--more-->

Using Python 3.13.0 and LabVIEW 2024 Q3 (will work for older versions for sure).

First run Server, then Client.

Python as Server:

```Python
# first of all import the socket library
import socket

# next create a socket object
s = socket.socket()
print ("Socket successfully created")

# reserve a port on your computer in our case it is 40674 but it can be anything
port = 40674

# Next bind to the port - we have not typed any ip in the ip field
# instead we have inputted an empty string this makes the server listen to requests
# coming from other computers on the network
s.bind(('', port))
print ("socket binded to %s" %(port))

# put the socket into listening mode
s.listen(5)    
print ("socket is listening")

# a forever loop until we interrupt it or an error occurs
while True:

    # Establish connection with client.
    c, addr = s.accept()
    print ('Got connection from', addr )

    # send a thank you message to the client.
    c.send(b'Thank you for connecting')

    # Close the connection with the client
    c.close()
```

According LabVIEW's Client:

and works:

```markup
>python Server.py
Socket successfully created
socket binded to 40674
socket is listening
Got connection from ('127.0.0.1', 52430)
```

### Opposite Direction â€” LabVIEW as Server and Python as Client:

LabVIEW Code:

![](assets/ServerSnippet.png)

and according Python Code:

```Python
# Import socket module
import socket

# Create a socket object
s = socket.socket()

# Define the port on which you want to connect
port = 40674

# connect to the server on local computer
s.connect(('127.0.0.1', port))

# receive data from the server
print(s.recv(24))

# close the connection
s.close()
```

Works as well:

```
>python Client.py
b'Thank you for connecting'
```

In both cases 24 bytes string was transferred.
