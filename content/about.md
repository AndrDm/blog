I'm just a curious software engineer.

This website as one of my exercises, written entirely in Markdown, builds with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and modified [Mainroad](https://github.com/vimux/mainroad) theme with [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) Font, powered by [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app) and [Matomo](https://matomo.org).
